# 📱 Motorola Sales Dashboard | Street Kid Series: Chapter 3

This Power BI project is not just data—it’s a reflection of a journey.

## 🔍 About the Project  
Analyzing Motorola’s sales behavior across India using transactional data, consumer preferences, and visual storytelling. The dashboard decodes insights on units sold, payment methods, ratings, and city-wise performance—showing how numbers tell stories if you know where to look.

## ✨ Personal Context  
Motorola was my first mobile—my introduction to digital life.  
As a curious kid from Rohtak, I held that device like a window to the world. Years later, I’m still holding onto it—only now it’s as a business analyst turning memories into market insights.

This dashboard reflects that full-circle moment—from emotions to Excel, screens to strategy.
